# Pass 84 owner feedback ledger — 2026-09-02, received ~06:50 BST (OMP session)

Owner directive: log every request before acting (OMP sessions are not
persistent). This file is the durable row home. Graph projection into
`PASS65_OWNER_FEEDBACK_COMPLETENESS_GRAPH.json` is queued as process work: the
gate validates chat-source entries against a strict raw-text + atom-counted
projection schema, and a hand-built projection risked breaking a green gate;
each row below carries its stable HF id and falsifier so the projection can
land without information loss.

Also received and logged (release policy, not a defect): **when the next pass
pushes, pin the then-current live version (PASS 83) as the sole safe backup and
remove every older version from the chooser and gh-pages.** Implemented in
`scripts/orchestration/publish_pass84.py` with the predecessor guard relaxed
from two recent predecessors to one pinned backup at the owner's direct
instruction, and the in-build fallback re-pinned to the backup.

## HF-395 — viewmodel still clips walls and floor "like crazy"

- **Owner lane:** first-person viewmodel presentation; all maps, all browsers.
- **Statement:** gun still clips through walls and floor like crazy despite the
  Pass 81 surface-plane fix (12/654 residual poses were documented at Bus/Van
  gap and Garage door).
- **Mechanical falsifier:** `scripts/qa/measure-viewmodel-penetration-cdp.mjs`
  poses report 0.000 m penetration on the named poses, and the floor plane
  holds at every stance.
- **Plan:** re-run the penetration instrument on the pass84 candidate, fix the
  residual poses and the floor-plane gap, add the poses to the ratchet.

## HF-396 — rail detached from barrel and scope on the flagged guns

- **Owner lane:** weapon presentation, scoped rifles.
- **Statement:** the rail is still detached from the barrel and scope on the
  few guns the owner previously flagged (scoped/railed rifles).
- **Mechanical falsifier:** per-flagged-weapon optic/rail socket alignment
  readback shows rail seated on barrel datum at ADS and hip.
- **Plan:** audit the flagged models' rail/optic nodes (`dump-glb-nodes`),
  align sockets in presentation code, add a per-weapon alignment contract.

## HF-397 — wall/floor viewmodel pullback too strong — halve it

- **Owner lane:** first-person viewmodel presentation; all maps.
- **Statement:** gun pullback when near a wall is too strong; owner asks to
  halve it.
- **Mechanical falsifier:** surface-retreat telemetry value halves on the same
  pose set while the near-plane-clear contract still passes.
- **Plan:** scale the pullback retreat input by 0.5; keep the final-Z near-plane
  floor clamp state-conditional; verify prone-contact `nearPlaneClear` and
  fire-kick clearance stay green.

## HF-398 — EBR: +40% damage, +25% fire rate

- **Owner lane:** weapon balance; M14 EBR.
- **Statement:** add 40% more damage to the EBR rifle and increase its fire
  rate by 25%.
- **Mechanical falsifier:** `gameplay-contract.test.ts` rows carry the new
  damage/rpm values and a new `metadata.changes` change id; catalog unit rows
  match exactly.
- **Plan:** update `src/combat/weapon-catalog.ts` EBR damage ×1.40 and rpm
  ×1.25 (rounded to the catalog's integer rpm), move the checked-in
  `baselines/pass65-candidate/gameplay-contract.json` rows in lockstep, add the
  change id.

## HF-399 — FPS regression: 150 → 40 on Quality mode, Atomic Acres

- **Owner lane:** performance; Atomic Acres, Quality profile, owner hardware.
- **Statement:** used to get 150 FPS on Quality; now ~40 on Atomic Acres.
- **Mechanical falsifier:** instrumented Quality-mode run on the owner route
  shows a measured root cause and a before/after presented-fps delta toward
  the historical number; zero in-combat pipeline creations retained.
- **Plan:** measure first (clip-plane count added by Pass 81, per-frame
  allocation, draw-call delta on atomic-acres vs other arenas), fix the named
  cause, verify with the cross-engine stall meter and the pipeline probe.

## HF-400 — release policy: pin PASS 83 as sole safe backup, remove older versions

- **Owner lane:** release policy.
- **Statement:** when the next pass pushes, pin this (current) version and
  remove all past versions; it is the safe backup.
- **Mechanical falsifier:** post-publish chooser exposes exactly PASS 84 +
  PASS 83 backup; every other channel tree is absent from gh-pages; publish
  guards (farcrysis hidden, predecessor = one pinned backup, fallback re-pinned
  to PASS 83) all pass.

## HF-401 — chopper pilot lag (continuation, instrument landed)

- **Owner lane:** chopper gunner ride; pilot side.
- **Statement (carried):** the ride lags; prior profilers only measured the
  observing peer.
- **Evidence recorded this pass:**
  `artifacts/qa/chopper-pilot/pilot-before.json` — a real possessed ride
  flushed **8 prewarm ghost records** (the per-frame `releaseUnseen` churn);
  staging did not light up active thermal layers, so the visual-cost half
  stays unproven and is NOT claimed fixed by mechanism alone.
- **Plan:** activation-edge flush (release once per reveal activation, retain
  hidden records otherwise, LRU-capped); pilot-side instrument now exists
  (`scripts/qa/profile-chopper-pilot-thermal-cdp.mjs`) for before/after rides
  with enemies staged in reveal range.
